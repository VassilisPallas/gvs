# Contributing to GVS

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

#### **Did you find a bug?**

- **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/VassilisPallas/gvs/issues).

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/VassilisPallas/gvs/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

- If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Use conventional commits

  - Each commit should contain the type of the commit (bug, feat, test, etc), the issue number and a short description of that patch. Eg. chore(ISS-30): Update something

- PR title should contains the issue number with the title. Eg bug(ISS-30): Fix indices issue

- PR should be has `develop` as a base, not `main`.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

- Drop me an email at vspallas@gmail.com and start writing code.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Testing and Coverage**

Every new feature and every bug should have tests as evidence. If not, the PR will not be approved.

Thanks!
